# The-Gas-Station
PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL BUILD AND BUGS MAY OCCUR.
AND THIS IS MADE BY ONE PERSON.

Introduction:
 
You are the night-shift worker at a small gas station. It’s quiet, too quiet. Something feels off about tonight—no customers, no traffic, just the faint hum of the lights and the emptiness of the night. Your job seems simple: take care of the gas station. But as you go about your tasks, you’ll discover that something far darker is waiting for you.

Story / Synopsis:

People in town whisper about this place. Some say it’s cursed, others say it’s haunted. Long ago, a girl named Agatha was struck and killed near the gas station, and ever since, strange things have been reported. Lights flickering, cold drafts where there shouldn’t be any, and the faint sound of a child crying when the wind is still.
You’ve always dismissed the stories as nonsense. Just rumors that spread in small towns where nothing else happens. But tonight, those whispers feel closer—like they’re pressing against the glass of the station windows, waiting to come in.
As you move through your tasks, the unease builds. Locked doors, misplaced keys, and the heavy weight of being watched remind you that you’re not as alone as you thought. The further you go, the more the gas station itself begins to feel like a trap.
You don’t know what’s real and what’s rumor anymore. All you know is that something is here with you tonight. Something that doesn’t want you to leave.

Objectives:

1. Find the Back Door Key – The main way out is locked, but maybe there’s another way.
2. Take Out the Trash – Do your job. Step outside into the darkness.
3. Return to the Gas Station – Head back inside. The air outside feels wrong.
4. Look for the Front Door Key – The front door shouldn’t be locked… but it is. You need to find out why.
5. Check the Bathroom – There’s something inside that you can’t ignore.
6. Escape the Gas Station – Survive the night and make it out alive.
